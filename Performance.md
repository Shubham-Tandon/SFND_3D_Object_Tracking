# Performance Evaluation

Welcome to the final project of the camera course. By completing all the lessons, you now have a solid understanding of keypoint detectors, descriptors, and methods to match them between successive images. Also, you know how to detect objects in an image using the YOLO deep-learning framework. And finally, you know how to associate regions in a camera image with Lidar points in 3D space. Let's take a look at our program schematic to see what we already have accomplished and what's still missing.



## FP.5 Performance Evaluation 1

The TTC calculated using Lidar point clouds is reasonable accurate as seen from the table as well as the graph below. There is, however, an anomaly at image 7 when the TTC shoots to 3.78s.
